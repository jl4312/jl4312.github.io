		<h4 style="text-align: center">Summary</h4>
		Flicker Fortress is a single-player 3D puzzle platformer where the player controls a firefly called Flicker who can meld/fuse with electrical devices. 
		Solve multiple puzzle levels laid through a clock tower with your powers and uncover the mystery of where Flicker's friends have gone. </br></br>
		<h6>Backstory:</h6>
		Once upon a time, numerous fireflies were flickering around. As time went on, they all vanished. 
		Now only one remains Flicker. She must journey through a dark, mysterious clock tower that holds the secret to her missing friends. 
		Gathering what remains of her brethren inside their encasements. 
		Can you help her on her journey to find all her friends?
		</br></br>
		This was a personal project I worked with a group of friends during our free time.
		We wanted to create a fun engaging 3D experience. 
		It was started from a game we previously worked on during college, ChiaroScuro. 
		We revisisted some of the mechanics and wanted to explore further in developing it.
		You can play the game now on itch.io at <a href="https://aquilateam.itch.io/flickerfortress">https://aquilateam.itch.io/flickerfortress</a>
